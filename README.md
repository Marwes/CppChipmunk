CppChipmunk
===========

Chipmunk wrapper for C++ generated by a lua script.

Relies on LuaFileSystem and LPeg (for parsing).

Notes:
This is still a work in progress and  there is likely bugs.

Access to the pointer to the wrapped structs are provided through the function 'get()',
however the field 'data' may not be written to since that is the pointer back to the c++ object.
Instead use the 'getUserdata()' and 'setUserdata()' methods which provides access to a data pointer on the c++ object.


If you have any suggestions or bugs to report, please let me know.
